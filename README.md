# [GraphaCSS - when graphs meet SASS](https://github.com/zetura/graphacss)

GraphaCSS is a graph pre-processor made entirely with SASS. You will not require any JavaScript library
to have animated charts anymore.

The goal is to have very lightweight charts using static HTML/CSS and CSS3 animations.

## Quick start

Clone the git repo â€” `git clone
                      https://github.com/zetura/graphacss.git`

Install gulp - `npm install`

Go to the index.html file with your browser

## Browser support

* Chrome *(latest 2)*
* Edge *(latest 2)*
* Firefox *(latest 2)*
* Internet Explorer 9+
* Opera *(latest 2)*
* Safari *(latest 2)*

*This doesn't mean that Graphacss cannot be used in older browsers,
just that we'll ensure compatibility with the ones mentioned above.*
